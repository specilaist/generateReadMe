# Generate README APP

## User Story

This app allows creators to generate a detailed README file by simply answering the questions given. 

## How it Works

This app uses the require function to add "Inquirer" and "Axios" into our app so that we can build our README from user input.
* The Inquirer function allows us to use the "questions" variable which is an array of objects.
 * Each object is a question that allows us to complete the new README.
* Axios allows us to get information from API's like the github API.
* This is what we use to get the username, github icon, and account email.
